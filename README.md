secretlounge-ng
---------------
Rewrite of [secretlounge](https://github.com/6697/secretlounge), a bot to make an anonymous group chat on Telegram.
This version is pseudonymous instead of anonymous (though it still supports anonymous mode).


## @BotFather Setup
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Say "/newbot"
3. Give it a name and an ID
4. Remember to eventually set the userpic and the about text.

6. `/setjoingroups`: disabled
7. `/setcommands`: paste the command list below

## Running on a server
1. You should either know this part, or get some general experience. Take a course! SSH, SFTP, and so on. Make sure you create a new user account to run the bots.
2. Setup: You might need to `sudo apt-get update` and then `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`. Use pip3 to install requirements.txt.
3. Copy default configuration from `config.yaml.example` to `bot1/config.yaml`. Edit `bot1/config.yaml` and paste in your bot key from BotFather.
4. Turn the python file into a program: `sudo chmod 755 secretlounge-ng`.
5. You'll want to run it on the server and close the SSH window, so use `sudo apt-get install screen`.

### Running:
1. `screen -dmS bot1` where 'bot1' can be any name you choose.
2. `./secretlounge-ng -c bot1/config.yaml`
3. On your keyboard, press `Ctrl + A`, then press `D` to leave that screen.
4. You can now `exit` and close your session

### Shutting it down:
1. `screen -Dr bot1` to resume
2. On your keyboard, press `Ctrl + C` to stop the program

## Create another bot
1. Make a `bot2` directory and copy `config.yaml.example` to `bot2/config.yaml`
2. Edit `bot2/config.yaml` and paste in your new bot key from BotFather. Also change 'bot1' to 'bot2' on the database line.
3. `screen -dmS bot2`
4. When you start secretlounge-ng, use the -c flag: `./secretlounge-ng -c bot2/config.yaml`

## Security
You should harden your server by doing a few other things:
- Disable SSH for root
- Close most of the ports. Change defaults for SSH and SFTP

## FAQ

1. **How do I ban/unban/whitelist/unwhitelist/etc a user?**

Generally speaking, you should reply to a user's message to perform an action on them. Reply to one of their messages with `/ban just because` or `/info` or `/warn`. Check out the `/modhelp` and `/adminhelp` commands.

Sometimes you can't access one of their messages. To whitelist a new user, unban someone who has no recent messages, or stuff like that, you can just use commands like `/whitelist` or `/unban` or `/demote` to show an anonymized list.

You can paste in their tripcode or obfuscated ID. For example, `/mod someone!d30I83hFJ2` will find that person and make them a moderator. Admins can also search by username or id, but be careful never to accidentally send that to everyone by forgetting the `/` at the start of your command. That sensitive data will be deleted automatically from your chat window.

2. **What is the suggested setup to run multiple bots?**

The administrative scripts support a structure like the following where each bot has its' own subdirectory:

```
secretlounge folder
\-- bot1
  \-- db.sqlite
  \-- config.yaml
\-- bot2
  \-- db.sqlite
  \-- config.yaml
\-- ...
\-- README.md
\-- secretlounge-ng
```
